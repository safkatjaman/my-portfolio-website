              So, people used to tell me that I am like a human who can't do anything. That's why I have started to learn web development. Although I used to an HTML lover since I was 17 years old. In Sha Allah one day I will be one of the best web developer of the world and make everyone proud. Specially my Mother and my Father.

                 They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remote web developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
